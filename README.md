Framework for nuanced social interactions for Mass Effect: Legendary Edition


## NOTES:
For all games:
* Validate current relationship state on __event__ (prob. entering Normandy).
  ** Check for newly-installed relationship mods / bools (to manage mods mid-install).
* Replace all social dialog BOOL checks / CND checks w/ Social Framework CND checks.
